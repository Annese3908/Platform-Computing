    <p>
        I spent 2 and 1/2 years studying under the Pre-Computer Science Major at Cal State LA. I did encounter some 
        difficulties while I was there; the commute was long and terrible, I was stalked within my first semester, one 
        summer session put me into credit debt, and I only took that summer session because I previously had to withdraw
        from an entire semester. These experiences and some other factors led to my decision to apply to transfer to CSUSB.
        I transferred here under the Computer Science major, but I plan on switching to Computer Systems in the Game 
        Development concentration. I also plan on minoring in Data Science while I'm here.

        Interests
    </div>
    <p>
        There are plenty of subjects I'm interested in but only a few that I'm willing to share. To start off, I aboslutely LOVE 
        video games. My favorite series are Little Big Planet, or SackBoy, Persona, The Legend of Zelda, Crash Bandicoot, Sonic
        the Hedgehog. I'm also into games like Elden Ring, Fortnite, and anything Lego related. I'm also really into art and I 
        used to make animations when I was younger. My other interests range from the basics like cartoons, manga, and music.

        Personal Life
    </div>
    <p>
        There isn't anything thats very interesting going on in my personal life. I could say I've been in a Jubilee video about
        breast sizes, I just hit 9 months in my first relationship, or I still live with my mom, but anybody could say these things.
        I usually spend most of my time sitting in my room if I'm not at school. On Fridays I visit my grandparents and we make breakfast
        together, and I spend the weekends with my boyfriend (usually at his place because his bed is bigger).
